    "bio":"Born in Denver Colorado, I came to UVA to study Computer Science. As a military child and member of a diverse family, I have traveled to many countries throughout North America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. These travels introduced me to a vast array of cultures, and I bring a global perspective with me to any workplace. I am passionate about software engineering because it allows me to combine my love for problem-solving with my diverse perspective to consider problems from multiple angles and develop an efficient solution.\n\n I am interested in innovation and am fascinated with how technology continues to transform our world. I enjoy working with others on projects, leading groups to tackle tasks, and providing support for other aspiring STEM students, like serving as a tutor in the Math Honor Society and TA for Intro to Programming at UVA. In my free time, I love to research different types of technology, play basketball, bike, and play video games.",
